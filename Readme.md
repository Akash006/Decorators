#       DECORATORS IN PYTHON
- A decorator is a **design pattern** in Python that allows a user to **add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure**.
- It allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class.
- Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
- In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.
- Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.
- **A decorator is a function that takes a function as its only parameter and returns a function**. This is helpful to “wrap” functionality with the same code over and over again.

##		Decorators have several use cases such as:

	* Authorization in Python frameworks such as Flask and Django
	* Logging
	* Measuring execution time
	* Synchronization
